# This is a basic mockup of a python program that optimizes the ff7 ever crisis guild battles

# ðŸ™‚

### some bugs/issues i haven't gotten around to fixing yet:

- because the program currently just tries to do every fight with the least attempts, stage 1 and 2 which usually a large subset can get 100% on are treated the same, will think about how to fix it but you can also go around the problem by planning accordingly and running the script for only higher stages
- not an issue but i want to pull mocks and live boss hp from the actual spreadsheet to run it more easily
